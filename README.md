Money printer is yet to go brrr. This is a learning exercise so I don't recommend you use it. 

A bot that is able to keep an up to date database of prices and place trade orders based on advice from an LSTM neural net. 

## Code extensions and improvement

new branch abc-refactor, to make some abcs to make a more well defined and extensible way to try out future models and new exchanges assets, etc..

## Model extensions and improvement
   
- model needs way more validation: precision, recall, f1 value, etc.
- test on definitely predictable data e.g. sin
- try training on fourier t
